# Interactive River-Aquifer Simulation (IRAS)

This repo is a clone of that found on Sourceforge (http://sourceforge.net/projects/iras/) with a couple of modifications to enabled IRAS to be compiled on gfortran. The FORTRAN source is available here along with a basic example. 

To run,

'''
make
cd example
../iras
'''

Note this has only been briefly tests on gfortran-4.9.2 on Linux.
