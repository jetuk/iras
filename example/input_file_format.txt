IRAS-2010 runs using a minimum of six input files: iras.inp, iras.pol, iras.gag, iras.def, iras.unt and iras.flw.
These input files can either be made manually by the user or automatically using the IRAS-2010 add-in in HydroPlatform (www.hydroplatform.org)

The iras.def file defines the start year, end year, time-step, number of subtime-steps and also defines which policy group is associated to which year of the 
    simulation (for annually changing parameters)
The iras.inp file is responsible for describing the modelled network and its parameters.
The iras.pol file is used to describe the date ranges for seasonally varying parameters. Most parameters and tables in IRAS-2010 can vary seasonally and annually.
The iras.unt file defines the conversion factors between the units used for the user-defined parameters and internal IRAS-2010 units.
The iras.gag file identifies the Gauge nodes (nodes with a flow time series) and Demand nodes that use a time series to define their demand.
The iras.flw file contains the time-series for gauge nodes in column order format. The time-step of the flow series is the same as the simulation time-step. 
    Columns are in the same order as the gauge nodes listed in iras.gag

If demand nodes with demand time-series are defined in iras.gag, then a separate iras.dem file is required that contains the demand time-series. This file 
    has the same format as the iras.flw file.

Before the input file format is discussed, some knowledge of how IRAS-2010 deals with seasonal and annual changes in parameters is required.
Seasonal values of a parameter are defined using Policies. Each Policy is given its own ID number (1,2,3 etc...). There can be any number of Policies within a year
for each parameter. The part of the year for which a given policy is applied is defined using date ranges. The only limitation is that the first policy starts on day 1 
and the last policy of the year ends on day 365. The beginning day of a policy is a whole number while the ending day should be .001 less than the start day of the next 
policy (e.g. 10.999 if the next start day is day 11). Policy durations can be any number of days (as long as they are at least the length of a time-step and not longer 
than a year) and they don't have to be equal in length to the other policies. An example of three Policies can be: 1 to 40.999, 41 to 350.999, 351 to 365.999. 
Each parameter (including tables) can have their own number of Policies for the year. For parameters that do not require seasonal changes, the default Poilcy ID is 1 and 
it is valid for the whole year. In this case, the policy data range of 1-365.999 does not need to be defined in 'iras.pol'.

Policies are stored together in annual sets called Policy Groups (PG). PGs are used to simulate annual changes in IRAS-2010. Each year in the IRAS-2010 simulation 
is assigned a PG. The use of Policies and PGs will be more clear when the file format is explained.

Below the input file formats of the IRAS-2010 input files are explained.

*****Allocation and Consumption Functions***** 
DIVERSION tables that define diversion functions to outgoing diversion links.

(6) Out LINK ID     LINK ID of link to which allocation is going
(7) Allocation	    Total Allocated to Link as function of value in (5)

Consumption functions are defined similarly to diversion functions:

Allocation: 1 1 1 7 35 0 15

(6) 0           
(7) Consumption	    Total flow consumed at node as function of value in (5)


*******Targets and Sources********** 
Targets are set for DEMAND nodes. They are either flow (non-storage DEMAND node) or storage (LAKES and RESERVOIR) targets.
Setting a RESERVOIR as a Source for a DEMAND node makes the RESERVOIR release additional water to satisfy any deficit in that DEMAND node.
DEMAND LINKS can also be set as Sources for DEMAND NODES. Water is allocated to DEMAND LINKS if their corresponding DEMAND node has a deficit.
DEMAND LINKS that are directly downstream of a DEMAND node do not require to be labeled as Source in order to receive allocation

Target: 1 1 1 9 20 0  
Source: 1 1 1 9 4 1 1   

Target:
(1)-(4) same as for 'Evaporation:', (3) is 1

(7) Contribution fraction of Source NODE or LINK            Defines what fraction of deficit the source is responsible for
 		


************* RESERVOIR Groups***************
RESERVOIR release rules can be defined for the Lead/Independent RESERVOIRS in a group. They define the supply based release
from a RESERVOIR as a function of its volume and day of the year. Usually several policies for RESERVOIR rules are used.


Rule: 1 1 17  0    0    200   5    0    0     250  5 
Rule: 1 1 17  200  5    600   5    250  5     700  5
Rule: 1 1 17  600  5    1000  5    700  5     1200 5
Rule: 1 1 17  1000 5    1400  5   1200  5     1400 5

a function of either the total volume of the group or of the volume in the lead/independent RESERVOIR.

----LOSS FOR LINKS----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are three ways to compute losses in unidirectional links.
Loss method 0 uses a Loss (flow units) vs. Total flow through link table
Loss method 1 uses Link length (Defined in NODES section) x Link Width to estimate the link surface area. Link width is calculated from a link rating table.
   An evaporation rate is then used together with the link area to obtain the total loss.
Loss method 2 is similar to method 1, but instead of using a Link rating table, it calculates the link width from Link cross section geometry data. 

Evaporation: 1 1 2 5 200 1 

(1)-(4) same as before (3) is 2
(5) Loss Rate   [distance/time](Only for Loss Rate method 1 and 2)
(6) Loss Method (0, 1, or 2 to define which loss method is used)

Note: Method 0 uses flow units for loss while methods 1 and 2 use length/time units 

Rating tables for links are only used if Loss Method is 0 or 1
